#### **A little about me**

> As a former architect, I have always enjoyed the diverse expressions of human nature. I strongly believe in the values 
that technology and diversity bring to our daily interactions. As a Software Development Student I want to participate in creating a future where technology is common language that reaches everyone who is curious, promotes mutual understanding 
and tolerance and makes communities stronger. I enjoy new challenges that allow me to use my education, skills and experience towards the continuous improvent of user experiences, bringing people together has always inspire me! For a fun fact, feel free to ask me about my sustainable housing designs, including urban farming.
